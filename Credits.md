---- Dead Scripts ----
----------------------

Credits
    Badger
        For making the scripts but having a lack of support for the scripts randomly breaking and him and his support staff
        blaming the one needing support for messing up the config.lua (even when the config.lua was not the issue)
    Any onther creator that was not mentioned within badgers scripts.


I appreciate those who make scripts whether free and paid and actually offer assistance for all issues and try their hardest to help their customers
Money is not worth losing a customer. You put your name on the line when you make a script and refuse to offer actual support. 

Yes this script is a "forked" version of Badgers. There were numerous flaws within the code that I had found and had been working on fixing and was going
to be polite and send him the files but after I joined his support server and was treated the way I was when asking for support and there were people with simular 
issues as mine. Yet the Support staff and Badger himself both were saying "something you did wrong in the config file messed up the script". I could see that if I had
just installed the scripts but not with them being in my server for multiple months and working one day then the next day (Literally) not working. 

I hope people enjoy the scripts I revised here and if anyone needs support with them join the discord server provided within the Readme.md Files within the script folders and you will get actual assistance and not blamed for an issue.
